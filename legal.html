              <!--<h3 class="text-center">Policy Summary</h3>-->
              Some important facts about your Home Sellers Property Completion Financial Guarantee - ClozeSure - are summarised below. This summary does not describe all the terms and conditions of the policy. To ensure full understanding of the cover provided we recommend that this document is read alongside the Guarantee wording.<br>
              <h4>Financial Guarantor</h4>
              This Financial Guarantee policy has been arranged by Contract Completion Company Ltd and is underwritten by XXX. Registered Office: XXX XXX XXX. Registered in England and Wales No. XXXXXX.<br>
              <h4>Eligibility</h4>
              You are eligible for this Financial Guarantee provided that, at the start date:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   You are aged 18 or over<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   You are selling a property in England,  Wales or Northern Ireland<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   You are the owner of the property<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Your buyer is a private individual/s (i.e. not buying your property on behalf of a corporate entity or trust),<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   You are unconnected to the buyer of your property<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Your buyer’s deposit, payable on exchange of contracts, is at least 10% of the agreed sale price of your property<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Your property is being sold with vacant possession on completion date,<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   You are using a solicitor or licensed conveyancer to conduct the conveyancing.<br><br>
              We will not provide any cover if you do not meet these eligibility requirements at the start date of your policy.<br>
              <h4>Claim Events</h4>
              This Financial Guarantee, subject to the terms and conditions, provides cover if your property sale does not complete during the period of cover due to your Buyer’s failure to complete, through no fault of your own and for reasons beyond your control, their contractually-agreed purchase of your property, in the time-frame set out by your Agreement of Sale contract and the subsequent Completion Notice served on your defaulting Buyer by your conveyancer.<br><br>
              The Financial Guarantor will pay you:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   the 90% balance of the sale price of your property due from your ‘failed’ buyer; being the difference between the 10% deposit received from, and forfeited in your favour, the buyer of your property and the total agreed sale price, as per your property sales contract, expected by you, the seller, on completion. Payment by us of your claim, and the transfer of ownership of your property to us, will constitute the completion of your property sale.<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Conveyancing Fees, up to a maximum of £2,000, incurred by you and charged by your conveyancer during the period between the contractually-agreed (failed) completion date of your property sale and the date of payment of your claim and transfer of ownership of your property to us. (To also include any conveyancing fees incurred by you during the processing of your claim in the instance of ‘buyer delay’ - where your buyer successfully completes their purchase of your property, albeit late, within the time-frame set out by the Completion Notice).<br>
              <h4>Period of Financial Guarantee</h4>
              The financial guarantee protection commences on the start date - the day contracts are exchanged with your buyer and your conveyancer receives from your buyer a deposit equivalent to 10% of the agreed sale value of your property. The financial guarantee will end automatically upon the first of:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   90 days from the Start Date<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   The successful completion of your Property sale to your Buyer<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   The date we pay a claim under this Financial Guarantee.<br>
              <h4>Excess</h4>
              This Financial Guarantee policy is excess free.<br>
              <h4>Exclusions</h4>
              It is important that you understand that the Financial Guarantor bears no liability for the following exclusions that apply to the whole of this policy and that this policy does not cover:<br>

              <b class="text-primary">4.</b>  Deliberate behaviour by You that results in the Buyer withdrawing from the Property sale.

              <b class="text-primary">5.</b>  You, the vendor, not being legally entitled to sell the property, or<br>

              <b class="text-primary">12.</b> Failure to complete directly or indirectly due to or resulting from your property being confiscated, taken, damaged or destroyed by or under the order of any government or public or local authority.<br>
              <b class="text-primary">13.</b> Any claim where you would be entitled to be paid under any other policy if this policy did not exist. However, this exclusion does not apply to any amount above that which would be covered under the other policy.<br>

              <h4>Making a Claim</h4>
              You should immediately advise us if your buyer fails, or looks likely to fail, to complete contracts for the purchase of your property on the agreed completion date. This should be before or on the intended (failed) day of completion of your property sale. Please contact us via the ClozeSure website before or on your failed completion date.  We will then start the claims process.<br><br>
              Alternatively, please send an email to xxxxx@xxxx.com or write to XXXX, XXXX, XXXXX.<br><br>
              You must give us all the co-operation we need to investigate your claim. You will need to provide us with information, including the following, to ensure we are able to meet our claims promise:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   A copy of the exchanged contracts, including your Agreement of Sale<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Proof of 10% deposit paid by your buyer and being held by your solicitor/conveyancer.<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Your conveyancer/solicitor’s client bank account details<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   Name and address and contact details of:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   your solicitor/conveyancer,<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   your estate agent,<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   the buyer’s solicitor/conveyancer.<br><br>
              On the defaulting buyer’s failure to complete on the agreed day of completion, your conveyancer will immediately issue your buyer, via the buyer’s own conveyancer, with a Completion Notice, with which the buyer must comply within, usually, 10 working days of the (missed) completion date. If the buyer fails to do so, your property contract for sale will be deemed to have failed and your defaulting buyer’s deposit should be forfeited in your favour and your claim payment will fall due.<br><br>
              Your claim will then be paid immediately by us to your conveyancer in exchange for the transfer, via your conveyancer and estate agent, from you to us of:<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   vacant possession of your property,<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   your property keys,<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   full access to your property, and<br>
              <i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   full ownership of and title to your property<br><br>
              From this point forth we will become the registered owners of the property.<br><br>
              On receipt of our settlement payment to your conveyancer they will then deduct their own fees (incurred up to the failed completion day) your estate agent’s fees and any other fees or costs due – including any outstanding mortgage charge/s – before passing on the balance of monies due to you.<br><br>
              Any conveyancing fees incurred by you during the period between the failed completion date and payment of our claim, will be invoiced to and paid by ourselves, up to a maximum of £2,000).<br><br>
              <h5>Our Claims Promise</h5>>
              We pride ourselves on offering a service that is fast, efficient and helpful. Our promise to you is pay your claim <b>immediately after, and on the same day as</b>, your defaulting buyer fails to comply with the Completion Notice and, thus, loses the right to buy your property and forfeits their 10% deposit in your favour.<b>We can only do this with the full cooperation of your conveyancer and you.</b><br><br>
              We appreciate that you may be simultaneously purchasing another property with the proceeds of your property sale and that you may, in turn, have received a Completion Notice from the seller of that property. We will work closely with your conveyancer, the seller’s conveyancer and any other connected parties to ensure that your onward property purchase completes successfully and the integrity of any chain of transactions remains intact.<br>
