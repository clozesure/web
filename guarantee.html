        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-5">
              <p class="text-justify">The ClozeSure Guarantee ensures that you are put back into the same financial position as you would have been had your property sale completed successfully.</p>
              <p class="text-justify"><i class="now-ui-icons education_paper text-primary"></i>   It is available at the time of exchange of contracts of sale and receipt of a 10% deposit from your buyer by your conveyancer/solicitor.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6 mt-4">

              <p class="text-justify"><i class="now-ui-icons business_money-coins text-primary"></i>   It will reimburse you for any additional legal and conveyancing costs incurred by you, up to a maximum of £2,000, because of your buyer’s failure, or delay, to complete.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">If your buyer fails to complete on the agreed Completion Date, the legal framework enables you to either <b>1</b>) grant your buyer an extension or <b>2)</b> serve your buyer with a valid Notice to Complete, with which they have to comply within 10 working days.</p>
              <p class="text-justify"><b>1)</b>  If you choose to grant your buyer an extension, you may request an extension to the period of your Guarantee.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">If your buyer successfully completes before the end of the 10 day Notice to Complete period, the Guarantee will pay for any additional conveyancing fees you incur as a result of your buyers delay.</p>
              <p class="text-justify"><b>2)</b>  If your buyer is unable to complete by the end of the 10th day Notice period, they forfeit their 10% deposit in your favour, as per the terms of your property sale contract. The Guarantee then steps in to immediately purchase your property, pay you the remaining 90% sum and cover your additional conveyancing fees incurred due to your buyer's failure.</p>
              <h3>Peace of Mind. Guaranteed.</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">The Guarantee is designed to offer complete peace of mind to property sellers by making your sale, and its timing, certain from the moment of exchange of contracts and deposit.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">You can also be re-assured that the Guarantee will pay out promptly, giving you the confidence to enter into any simultaneous property purchase or other time-dependent financial commitment.</p>
              <h3>Our Claims Promise</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">We pride ourselves on offering a service that is fast, efficient and helpful. Our promise to you is pay your claim <b>immediately after, and on the same day as</b>, your defaulting buyer fails to comply with the Completion Notice and, thus, loses the right to buy your property and forfeits their 10% deposit in your favour. <b>We can only do this with the full cooperation of your conveyancer and you.</b></p>
              <p class="text-justify">We appreciate that you may be simultaneously purchasing another property with the proceeds of your property sale and that you may, in turn, have received a Completion Notice from the seller of that property. <b>We will work closely with your conveyancer, the seller’s conveyancer and any other connected parties to ensure that your onward property purchase completes successfully and the integrity of any chain of transactions remains intact.</b></p>
              <h3>Current Restrictions</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">Currently the Guarantee is only available to property sellers where a minimum deposit of 10% of the agreed sale price of their property has been paid.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">It is not available to sellers if their buyers are not private individuals (i.e. the buyer is a corporate entity or trust of some kind) or where any of the sellers has a previous or current relationship with the buyer, whether family, social or business..</p>
              <p class="text-justify">It is not currently available for commercial properties or for exchange-completion periods exceeding 3 months.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">These restrictions may change in future product developments so please check back regularly if this impacts you.</p>
              <h3>Government Limitations</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">In the event that the Government introduces limitations placed on property purchases that cause delay to your completion date (as in the recent case of Covid19), the Guarantee period shall be frozen until the limitations are relinquished. At this point, the Guarantee period will be extended by the days remaining from the original period.</p>

                              Answer: You should immediately log in to the site and start the Claims process.
                              <p class="mb0 mt-4">Your conveyancer will immediately issue your buyer, via their own conveyancer, with a Completion Notice, with which they (the buyer) must comply within, usually, 10 working days of the (missed) completion date.

                                 Your claim will be paid by Us to your conveyancer in exchange for the transfer, by your conveyancer, from you to Us, of vacant ownership and full title and ownership of your property.</p>
                              <p>Your conveyancer will follow the same process - as if your property sale had completed successfully - by deducting their fees, your estate agent’s fees and any other fees or costs due – including any outstanding mortgage charge/s – before passing on the balance of monies (including your buyer’s deposit) due to you.</p>
                              <p>You have no further interest in, or liability for, your ‘claimed’ property, which is now in the ownership of the Guarantor. Any additional costs incurred on the property – for which you bear no liability - will be borne in full by the Guarantor.

It does so by paying out to you, on the day that your buyer fails to comply with your conveyancer’s completion notice (usually 10 working days after the failed completion date), the sum guaranteed – being the balance due between the deposit paid to you by your buyer & the agreed sale price of your property – in return for the transfer of ownership & vacant possession of your
                                property to the Guarantor. Any additional conveyancer fees (up to a maximum of £2,000) incurred by you between the failed completion date and the payment of your claim will be paid by the Guarantor.For the cost of your one-off premium payment, you are thus placed back into the same financial position as if your property sale had completed successfully.</p>

                              Answer: You will not be able to claim under this Guarantee.
                              <p class="mb0 mt-4">This is due to your failure to fulfil your obligations under the sale agreement and would result in your having to return the deposit to the buyer and you may be liable for their costs, damages and losses incurred by your breach of contract. It therefore would not constitute a successful claim by you under this Guarantee & you would not be entitled to a return of your premium unless the Guarantee has been cancelled during the cancellation period.</p>

                              Answer: This is entirely up to you. You could grant them a delay or this could result in a claim under the Guarantee.
                              <p class="mb0 mt-4">If you are able to and feel inclined to granting your buyer a delay you are free to do so. You must inform us immediately of your revised Completion date so that your Guarantee’s coverage period can be extended (subject to a maximum of 2 weeks).</p>
                              <p>If you refuse your buyer’s request for a delay, and they fail to complete on the agreed completion date, your conveyancer will immediately send them a completion notice. At the same time, you should immediately start the claims process on our website.</p>
